The Chi-Square Goodness of fit is used to reject or accept a hypothisized distribution for a dataset.

This is done by comparing the expected Cumalitive Distribution Function of a given interval to observed value of that interval.

The chi-square value is: 

Sumation: ((actual - expected)^2)/expected

You reject the hypothesis if the chi-square value is larger then the value on the chi-square table at the degree of freedom for the distribution at an alpha of 5%.
