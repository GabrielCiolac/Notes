# Simulation

Imitates a real-world system over time. Simulations generate a series of event and actions of a system, and use this data to make approximations of the real-world system.

The Simulation Model is the set of rules, assumptions and relationships which describe the system as a whole. Changes to this model can be used to answer questions regarding the real world.

## When to use simulation
1. When it could be used to study a complex system
2. When it's possible to observe changes in the model
3. When the design of the simulation can be used to gain insight in the real system
4. When there's insight to be gained in chaging the model
5. When simulations can explain mathimatical solutions
6. When you want to experiment with new policies before implementation
7. When simulations can prove mathematical solutions
8. When simulations can elicit requirements (requirement elicitation)
9. When system is too complex to be solved mathematically

## When not to use simulation
1. When the solution is found through common sense
2. When the solution can be found analytically
3. If performing experiments is cheaper
4. If costs exceeds value
